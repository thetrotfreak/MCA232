### **Hypotheses:**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The mean perceptions of the impact of webinar and seminar attendance on academic performance are the same among participants.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant difference in the mean perceptions of the impact of webinar and seminar attendance on academic performance among participants.

> Type of T-Test: This scenario corresponds to an Independent Two-Sample T-Test.

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, attr.source='.numberLines'}
graduates <- df[
    df$`What is your current level of education?`
    %in%
    c(
        "Undergraduate (Bachelor's degree)",
        "Graduate (Master's or higher)"
    ),
]

graduates$Attendance <- as.numeric(
    factor(
        x = graduates$`Do you attend webinars and seminars related to your study?`,
        levels = c(
            "Strongly Disagree",
            "Disagree",
            "Neutral",
            "Agree",
            "Strongly Agree"
        )
    )
)

t_test_result <- t.test(
    formula = Attendance ~ `What is your current level of education?`,
    var.eqaul = TRUE,
    data = graduates
)
```

### **Conclusion:**

-   **p-value (0.08349) \> 0.05:** This suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

-   **Confidence Interval:** At 95% confidence interval, there is no significant difference in the mean perceptions of attendance between Graduate and Undergraduate participants.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Hypotheses:**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The means of responses to the accessibility of webinars are equal across different educational levels.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** At least one group mean of responses to the accessibility of webinars is different from the others.

> Type of ANOVA Test: This scenario corresponds to a one-way ANOVA.
